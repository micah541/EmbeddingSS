Shakespeare and Satoshi : using embeddings and LSTM to metricize
authorship


We train an LSTM for next word prediction, using embeddings for authors of the work as well as word-embedding.   After training, we analyze the Euclidean metric on the embedding space for the authors. 
Data is taken from https://github.com/jlwatson/cs224n-project

Folder contains some of the embedding coordinates for the experiments
